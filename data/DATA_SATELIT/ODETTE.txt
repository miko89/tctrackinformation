REMARKS:
Tropical Cyclone Odette location was based on animated infrared and past
microwave imagery around 2100UTC. Confidence in the position is good. There has
been increasing confidence of an increase in intensity with the main convective
mass now located over the low level centre, and with banding also evident in
microwave imagery.

Dvorak analysis gives a DT 3.0 from both a curved band and shear pattern. MET is
3.5 adjusted to a PAT of 3.0, FT and CI are also 3.0. CIMSS ADT CI is 3.2 and
NOAA ADT has a CI of 3.3. SATCON was 54 knots [1-minute] at 1812UTC. Final
intensity set to 45 knots [10-minute].

Steering of Tropical Cyclone Odette has been to the east-northeast overnight and
early this morning. This is being significantly impacted by interaction with
Tropical Cyclone Seroja. There is good model consensus that steering over the
remainder of Friday will be to the east and southeast, prior to turning south to
south-southwest during Saturday.

Shear remains moderate to high with good poleward outflow and warm sea surface
temperatures [29-30C]. As TC Odette and TC Seroja continue to interact, Odette
should begin weakening during Saturday as Seroja dominates. An impact to the far
northwest corner of WA coast around Exmouth is possible on Saturday with a short
period of strong to gale force winds and rain even though the system should no
longer be a TC.
