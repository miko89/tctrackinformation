REMARKS:
After a period of weakening on Thursday, Seroja has commenced intensifying in
the past few hours with deep convection on both microwave [SSMIS at 2240UTC] and
visible imagery in bands north and south of the centre.

Dvorak analysis: FT/CI=3.0 based on MET. Technically DT=2.5 based on 0.4 curved
band pattern, but this does not reflect that there are multiple bands that is
heralding an emerging stronger system. ADT estimates are in the range of 2.4
[NESDIS] to 2.8 [CIMSS] and SATCON [18UTC] at 44 kn. Earlier ASCAT passes
[13-15UTC] had 35-40kn in eastern quadrants. Intensity set at 40kn.

Intensification should continue today and tomorrow as the shear [CIMSS 18UTC: E
at 12kn] eases and warm sea surface temperatures. There is the potential for
Seroja to reach category 3 intensity over the weekend with a poleward outflow
channel expected to develop due to an approaching upper trough to the west of
the system. The intensification process of Seroja may be complicated or enhanced
by the close proximity of TC Odette on Saturday.

Tropical cyclone Seroja is forecast to track towards the southwest over open
waters today under the influence of a mid-level high situated to the east of the
system and then take a slow southerly track on Saturday. On Sunday, Seroja is
expected to turn to the southeast due to an approaching mid-latitude trough from
the west and accelerate towards the west coast of Western Australia before
making landfall during late Sunday or early Monday between Carnarvon and Jurien
Bay, an area not accustomed to tropical cyclones making impacts more
significant.
